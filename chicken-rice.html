To top it off, the chicken served could be either roasted or steamed.¬†</p><p>Personally, I do not eat Chicken Rice for the chicken, I eat it for the rice, as I feel the rice is what sets apart from one stall / shop to another. Honestly, if the rice is that delicious, like from the stalls listed below, I feel I can eat an entire barrel of just the rice. In most cases, the chicken tastes similar to me (please dont sue xD). I should know better, as I have been eating this for most of my life, since childhood. And, it is for that reason, I have narrowed down to three of the best Chicken Rice stalls (in my opinion) in this country.</p><p>In no particular order:<br><br>1) Loy Kee Best Chicken Rice - Balestier Road<br>I'm not sure whether they changed, but the last I had, their choice of rice (looking at the length of the grains, Basmati, I presume?) absorbs the fragrance so much, such that the rice need not have the oil dressings (that come with the chicken) to go with. I also remember, they used to have Nasi Lemak as well, in which i swapped the Coconut Milk rice for Chicken Rice rice. Their chicken, is a little tough for me, and if their rice is combined with the chicken from the stalls next in this list, it is chicken rice heaven!</p><p>2) Feng Feng Hainanese Chicken Rice - Marsiling<br>On a good day, their rice has a balanced level of the chicken-oiliness, which creates the savoury flavour; best paired with the oil seasonings they drizzle over the chicken. Chicken is tender. Whether you are lucky or not, they also do serve achar (pickled cucumber / pineapple) to go with the meal. All in all, an excellent, economical meal.</p><p>3) Yishun 925 - Yishun<br>I know there are outlets other than the one in Yishun, such as one in Jurong East. They have a similar taste profile to Feng Feng, but their rice is quite consistent with the quality, oiliness level, and fluffliness, in every visit that I pay. Chicken is also soft and tender, which is bathed in the sesame oil dressing.</p><p>Well, there you have it. Whether you live here or whoever is visiting Singapore, and is willing to travel for good Chicken Rice, consider visiting these places that I have listed. Again, this is just my humble opinion on the best Chicken Rice spots. If you know one, you could let me know (once I figured out how to input some communication channels).<br><br></p><p>Warmest,<br>- Stephano</p></div></div></article></main><div class="right-bar"><div class="right-bar__inner"><div class="sidebar"><section class="box tags"><h3 class="box__title">Recommended Topics</h3><ul class="tags__list"><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://LCStephano.github.io/the_memoirs/tags/08-august/" class="btn btn--gray">08/2025</a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://LCStephano.github.io/the_memoirs/tags/food-and-drinks/" class="btn btn--gray">food and bev</a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://LCStephano.github.io/the_memoirs/tags/pilot/" class="btn btn--gray">pilot</a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://LCStephano.github.io/the_memoirs/tags/random-rambles/" class="btn btn--gray">random thoughts</a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://LCStephano.github.io/the_memoirs/tags/reflections/" class="btn btn--gray">reflections</a></li></ul></section></div></div></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://LCStephano.github.io/the_memoirs/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=b2d91bcadbf5db401b76eb5bb3092eb7"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
