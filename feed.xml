                <p>Hainanese Chicken Rice - IT'S THE BEST!</p>
<p>Where I am from, Chicken Rice could very well be a staple dish for most individuals - simple, economical, comforting and delicious.</p>
<p>To the uninitiated, Chicken Rice very well consists of chicken, and rice! üòÅ<br>But not just any rice, as the rice has to be cooked with the broth created from the chicken, with some ginger, pandan leave, and some other seasoning (one can search for the recipe online). To top it off, the chicken served could be either roasted or steamed.¬†</p>
<p>Personally, I do not eat Chicken Rice for the chicken, I eat it for the rice, as I feel the rice is what sets apart from one stall / shop to another. Honestly, if the rice is that delicious, like from the stalls listed below, I feel I can eat an entire barrel of just the rice. In most cases, the chicken tastes similar to me (please dont sue xD). I should know better, as I have been eating this for most of my life, since childhood. And, it is for that reason, I have narrowed down to three of the best Chicken Rice stalls (in my opinion) in this country.</p>
<p>In no particular order:<br><br>1) Loy Kee Best Chicken Rice - Balestier Road<br>I'm not sure whether they changed, but the last I had, their choice of rice (looking at the length of the grains, Basmati, I presume?) absorbs the fragrance so much, such that the rice need not have the oil dressings (that come with the chicken) to go with. I also remember, they used to have Nasi Lemak as well, in which i swapped the Coconut Milk rice for Chicken Rice rice. Their chicken, is a little tough for me, and if their rice is combined with the chicken from the stalls next in this list, it is chicken rice heaven!</p>
<p>2) Feng Feng Hainanese Chicken Rice - Marsiling<br>On a good day, their rice has a balanced level of the chicken-oiliness, which creates the savoury flavour; best paired with the oil seasonings they drizzle over the chicken. Chicken is tender. Whether you are lucky or not, they also do serve achar (pickled cucumber / pineapple) to go with the meal. All in all, an excellent, economical meal.</p>
<p>3) Yishun 925 - Yishun<br>I know there are outlets other than the one in Yishun, such as one in Jurong East. They have a similar taste profile to Feng Feng, but their rice is quite consistent with the quality, oiliness level, and fluffliness, in every visit that I pay. Chicken is also soft and tender, which is bathed in the sesame oil dressing.</p>
<p>Well, there you have it. Whether you live here or whoever is visiting Singapore, and is willing to travel for good Chicken Rice, consider visiting these places that I have listed. Again, this is just my humble opinion on the best Chicken Rice spots. If you know one, you could let me know (once I figured out how to input some communication channels).<br><br></p>

                <p>Let us start off with something borderline unhinged.</p>
<p>We have all seen our fair share of slasher / thriller films, such as "Saw", "Scream", "Nightmare on Elm Street", "Halloween", so on and so forth. Out of all of them, I would have to say Michael Myers (Halloween) is my favourite. But, really, the love for Michael Myers cemented when I was playing <em>Dead by Daylight</em>¬†back in the day.</p>
<p>Stealth, stalk, slit - that is his killing philosophy. Simple, easy and contemporary, it gets the job done. The other killers play with their victims too much, in my opinion. In some ways, it kind of disrupts the aura and mystique around those characters.</p>
<p>Chucky: screws around too much, even though he is hard to catch and skittish (which I understand, is part of his character). This little rat somewhat gave me a somewhat traumatic lasting impression during childhood, though it is non-existent now.</p>
<p>Freddy Krueger: can't really remember much as it was plenty of years ago I watched. But I know, if one dies in the dream, he dies in real life too.</p>
<p>Jigsaw: I do not think I can survive in any of Jigsaw's games üòÖ</p>
<p>Jason Voorhees: never really watched Friday the 13th series. I cannot comment.</p>
<p>Ghostface: while his stealth is on-point, I can understand his thing for psychological warfare by calling his victims before killing them. Still, not my thing.</p>
<p>Which is why Michael Myers is my favourite. I would like to think I have a fighting chance against him, even though the odds are against me. I can run, but I would also expect him to walk faster than I run, or appear somewhere bamboozling me xD</p>
<p>I have watched the original 1978 film, Halloween II, and the recent reboot from 2018 to 2022. I did not really bother watching those in between, as I feel like, from the little snippets that I have watched on Youtube, it did not really bring justice to his character. Michael Myers is literally the Evil Incarnate, with an ungodly tolerance to pain. The original first two, and the recent reboot did really bring out something: the <em>fear</em>, the thriller "<em>oomph!</em>" that really brings you into the movie, and, to some extend, feeling what Michael's victims are experiencing.</p>
<p>Watching the recent and modern reboot has me rooting for both Laurie Strode and Michael Myers. Watching "Halloween Ends" was kind of a bittersweet moment. As much as I did not want this awesome franchise to end, I would still have to let go, as everything has to come an end. However, the legend behind the story of Michael Myers (and Laurie Strode, of course), will forever live. Also, the seemingly infinite amount of jumpscares when playing against Michael Myers in <em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</p>
<p>Could I also do a shoutout to the music composer behind those Halloween films I've watched - John Carpenter. As I understand, his son worked with him on the 2018 to 2022 films. How one simple melody, played with the right tempo and instrument, can be so menacing and thrilling. Just when you think they cannot outdo the original, they somehow managed to pull it off. Case in point: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8H3M0DDWDs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Shape Hunts Allyson - John Carpenter</a>, from Halloween 2018.</p>
<p>Well, there you have it: awesome character(s), with a great aura and mystique around Michael Myers, slapping music to lift up the characters of the movie, and a beautiful thrilling energy to not make you want to look, but still take a peek to find out what happens next to the victims. This is Halloween.<br><br></p>

<p>Hello! My name is Char Gonzalo, just a random common human on this rock, made from star-dust floating through space, surviving and experiencing life. This space acts as a diary of sorts, in the case I ever suffer from Alzheimer's or Senile Dementia xD</p>
<p>I also hope to bring some form of entertainment through the day-to-day shenanigans, some thought-provoking topics, and also to share some random things that could be going through my mind. I shall try to update as and when I can.</p>
<p>Till the next post...<br><br>Warmest,<br>- GonzaloX41</p>
