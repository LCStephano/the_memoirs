Today's post is somewhat controversial and might trigger some, but these are my thoughts and they will stay with me till I go inside a casket. I do not give a rat's ass if anyone is offended, and I will not change them. I will not take down this post as well. I'm NOT sorry.</p><p>In my last post, I wrote that I was not a religious man. Of course, from my childhood to teen years, it was mostly my Mom's influence on me on these matters, though during my teen years, this influence was starting to waiver as that was when I started to think for myself, making sense of the world.</p><p class="msg msg--success"><em>"Just like to shoot straight, I'm a man of Science." - Rick Sanchez, Rick &amp; Morty</em></p><p>Long story short, I do not believe in religion or supernatural entities; at the very least, until they can be studied, measured, and logged into a record of sorts. It is simple really - in science, for every electrically neutral atom, for every proton, there must be an electron. Newton's Third Law of Motion: for every action, there must be an opposite and equal reaction. If there is a good, there must be a bad. If I do not believe in one, logically, I would not believe in the other.</p><p>The very concept of Gods and Demons had always been a man-made thing, starting from say 50,000 to 60,000 years ago, when humans evolved some form of complexity or sophistication in our cognitive process. For example, when a volcano erupts, or it is heavily storming with thunderous roars, our forefathers would have thought the gods are angry, probably requiring a sacrifice.</p><p>Over the years, over time, religion has evolved into what it is today. There could have been some evidence(s) that certain individuals tied to the religions today existed, but then yet again, how credible are said evidences?</p><p>On the other hand, Science, consistently proves itself, remains constant, in accordance to our laws of physics, and discovers new things. In science, there is nothing to <em>believe</em>, it is whether you <em>accept</em>.</p><p>Today you can ask me, "what was there before nothing?"<br>I would reply, "I don't know."<br>"Then God must have created it then..."<br>So what created "God"?</p><p>I think when it comes to the universe, I would believe that everything was once a single super-dense object, smaller than a grain of rice, in which it exploded, expanded to what we are today. Scientists say the universe is ever expanding, some say there is a "Great Attractor" and we are heading towards it. I feel, the whole universe could be a vicious cycle. Condense into a singularity, expand, contract and condense to a singularity again.</p><p>Yet again, this is the beauty of science, because science has yet to tread these ever-lasting mysteries. If it ever did (and it will eventually), religion is ever a receding pocket of scientific ignorance. I think Ricky Gervais says it best, and I quote "destroy all the religious books now, in 1000 years, they will come back different. Destroy all the science books now, in 1000 years, they will still come back the same".</p><p>It might seem I'm bashing on religion, but these are just my reasoning as to why I'm an advocate of science. Honestly, no offense. And I can get why people need religion, as they need something to hold on to, to have faith. No right or wrong, to each his own. For me, I will face whatever as it is.</p><p> </p><h3>A Curveball</h3><p>Side track a little, since we are on religion and science. I have a friend that has the "third eye", meaning she can see, experience and interact with supernatural beings, good or bad. We call her the "Ghost Hunter".</p><p>Again, I do not believe in these stuffs, but when it comes to her, I will not label her as a "schizophrenic" because it does not make sense to do so, and it is low-key offensive to just dismiss her experiences. She is a very good friend for years, and she has no reason to lie. When it comes to this, at best, I am a skeptic. I believe in her beliefs of these experiences. Again, I will fully believe when these entities can be measured in one way or another.</p><p>Maybe, let's just say these entities exists: what if she is one of those who can tap into a higher dimension to interact with these entities? What if these entities exist in a dimension that is beyond our own (3 dimensions that of space, 1 of time). What if this is the next step in human evolution, to transcend time to whenever we want (something like in the movie <em>Interstellar</em>)?</p><p>Just a little something to ponder.</p><p> </p><p>Warmest,<br>- Stephano</p></div></div></article><div class="post__comments"><div class="wrapper"><div class="comments"><div class="comments-wrapper"><h3>Comments</h3><div id="graphcomment"></div><noscript>Please enable JS to use the comments form.</noscript><script type="text/javascript">var __semio__params = {
